# Meeting One-on-One with your Outcomes Coach

We love meeting and talking with you, please don't be shy! You can schedule a longer one-on-one with us through our calendars. You will have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with your local coach within the first five weeks of the course, but if you would like additional time, click on the links below. 

One-on-Ones are a safe space to talk about literally anything. One-on-Ones might include:
- Your previous work history 
- Goals for your future 
- Creating your job search strategy 
- Getting you past roadblocks 
- Follow up or networking strategies 
- Feedback on your materials 
- Emotional issues

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared and be on time! We also ask that you let us know if you have to cancel your time slot. Be sure to slack your coach beforehand in terms of a specific location to meet.
