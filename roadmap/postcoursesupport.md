## What happens after graduation?

Congrats, you graduated from GAâ€™s Web Development Immersive Program! We are so proud of all of your hard work and you should be too. We know that you may have a few additions to your resume and portfolio, or may want some additional practice to work on your pitch - we got you covered!  You will work closely with your coach to discover how to best sell your talents to employers and set yourself up for success in your job search. Here are some things to be aware of going forward. 

## Final Outcomes Toolkit Materials 
**You MUST have all of your job search materials 100% done by the Wednesday following graduation at 7 PM.** 
We expect your Resume, Cover Letter, LinkedIn, GA Profile, and Portfolio to be final at this point. By this we mean you would be ok if an employer saw any of these materials. Remember that these materials are required to receive ongoing support from Outcomes.

## Keep in Contact with Your Coach

Remember, that we are here to support you each step of the way.  The best thing you can do is to keep us in the loop and let us know what is going on. Your local coach will review what it means to be a strategic job seeker, the requirements for maintaining Outcomes support, and what to expect in the upcoming months. In the meantime, don't hesitate to schedule time with your coach for specific needs. 

## Monday Check In Email

Each Monday, Nicole will send you an email with the subject line: #MotivationMonday - DATE. This email will contain helpful articles, recent job posting, words of wisdom and a reminder link to complete the Monday check in survey. Every job seeker is expected to complete the check in each week.

## Job Seeker Standups

Every Monday, there will be a Job Seeker Standup call via Zoom from 3-4pm EST/2-3pm CST/1-2pm MST/12-1pm PST. These calls will be mandatory every week and then will change to bi-weekly, still mandatory once you hit 60 days into your search. You will be required to attend these calls and will only be excused if you have an interview. We'll do refreshes of the topics discussed in class, along with sharing what's happening in the job search, areas people are struggling, do mock interview practice and portfolio presentations, and anything else folks want to talk about. These calls are for job seekers so we'll talk about whatever is top of mind for you! 

## Week 13.5 Outcomes Bootcamp

There will be a mandatory Outcomes Bootcamp on May 16 from 12-2pm EST/11am-1pm CST/10am-12pm MST/9-11am PST. We'll discuss how to tackle life after GA (goal setting, time management, job search review, etc.).
