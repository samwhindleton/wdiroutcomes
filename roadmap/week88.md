#  Application Strategy [Defining Your Non-Negotiables +  + Cover Letters]

## Framing:

What is a must-have in your next career? How do you narrow down your job search strategy? What is the must-have versus nice-to-have? Being able to communicate WHY you want a job is just as important as why you are a good fit for a job. We will tackle these questions and more this week. Be ready with your Organizational Research for a deep dive. 

From there, we'll be digging into the best way to find and apply for jobs. We'll walk through the application process and how if utilized correctly you can decrease the number of applications you are sending but maximizing the results. 

We'll also discuss cover letters and the role they play in the application process. It is important to create a strong cover letter, even if employer don't read them, and we'll review some examples and have time to spend individually drafting our cover letter templates.
