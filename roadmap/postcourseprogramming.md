# What happens after graduation?

Congrats, you graduated from GA’s Immersive Program! We are so proud of all of your hard work and you should be too. We know that you may have a few additions to your resume and portfolio, or may want some additional practice to work on your pitch - we got you covered!  You will work closely with your coach to discover how to best sell your talents to employers and set yourself up for success in your job search. Here are some things to be aware of going forward. 

# Final Outcomes Toolkit Materials 
**You MUST have all of your job search materials 100% done by the Monday following graduation at 7 PM.** 
We expect your Resume, Cover Letter, LinkedIn, GA Profile, and Portfolio to be final at this point. By this we mean you would be ok if an employer saw any of these materials. Remember that these materials are required to receive ongoing support from Outcomes.


# Portfolio Reviews 

The Portfolio Review is an opportunity for you to get firsthand experience sharing your work and showing off everything you have worked so hard for with GA!  Be prepared to discuss your work, your plans for completing any unfinished pieces, and most importantly your process. You will work with your coach as to what to expect for your portfolio review. 

# Meet & Hire Networking Event 

## Framing:

Experience the reverse career fair - you set up a table and employers spend time walking through the GA campus, meeting you, and looking at your work. The Meet & Hire will give you the chance to connect one on one with recruiters, hiring managers, and the GA Community! 

To get prepared, below are some helpful tips to jumpstart your road to success! You should have your portfolio, your 2 minute elevator pitch, 20 hard copies of your resume, and your game face on...ready to talk about your talents and hard work! 

**Run of Show:** You will be stationed at your own tables. Think of it as a reverse career fair. Employers will be the ones walking around to get to know you, see your portfolios, and find relevant talent for openings within their organizations. You will be doing a lot of talking!!!!

## Some house cleaning items and etiquette/best practices:

* GET SOME SLEEP & Drink extra water the day before! All jokes aside, get some rest so you can present your best self.
* Be early! You are to arrive 1 hour prior to the event Start Time for setup and pep talk. If you are late you will forfeit your spot.
* You will be choosing your spot, and early bird gets the worm :)

* Make sure your Portfolio is 100% complete. You cannot participate if your portfolio is not done.

* Make sure your [GA Profile](https://profiles.generalassemb.ly/) is published and perfect!!

* Charge your laptop - Make sure you come with a full charge.

* Clean your desktop. Move any unnecessary files and folders.

* Clean your browser. Hide your bookmarks bar and keep one tab open for your portfolio. (Multiple tabs are fine if you have each of your projects on there)

* Clean your actual computer. 

* Bring business cards if you have them (not required). 

* Bring at least 20 printed resumes. In general recruiters will want a hard copy. We will not be able to print them here. If you don't have a printer, we recommend Staples, FedEx Office, or even your public library. Don't worry about printing on fancy paper, you won't need it and we don't want to break your bank! 

* Bring something to take notes on and figure out a system that works for you to track the people you meet. Remember, you will need to follow up with EVERY contact you make. It's always nice to reference discussion points in your follow up email. 

* Be inclusive during the event. It's important to make sure no one is left waiting to talk to you. Invite them to join the conversations you are already having. It would not be uncommon for people from multiple organizations gathering around your station to hear what you have to say.

* Dress nicely but be comfy. You don't need to go suit & tie, but try to stay away from crazy t-shirts. Remember you will be standing for at least 3 hours.

* GA will be providing you with bottles of water and mints.

* Be prepared to speak up and make eye contact...this is YOUR show!

## Be prepared with your 2 Minute Elevator Pitch!

You want to be prepared to provide a brief overview of who you are, what you graduated from, your project, and what you hope to accomplish in your next job.  

**Example:**

Hi!  My name is NAME.  I just graduated the X GA Immersive and really enjoyed learning about X.  My background is X.  The Project that you see here today is X and essentially it tackles X.  My goal in my next opportunity is X.  I am so thrilled you stopped by. Thank you so much EMPLOYER NAME!

Practice your pitch at least 10 times the day before.  Be sure you sound calm, confident, and sincere.  Practice enunciating your words, speaking up and making eye contact. Take out the filler word ("*Aum, Like, Well, So, Uh", etc)

## Follow up thank you email:

{Optional addition based on the conversation you had: I’d love to hear more about your work and what you are looking for. Are you available next week at XYZ time?}
