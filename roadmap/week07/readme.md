# Preparing for the Behavioral Interview 

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand what makes a successful interview 

* How to prepare for the interview

* How to present your unique story

* Practice interviewing 

## Framing: (5/5)

Everyone’s brand is different and unique; it is how you present yourself that matters. We all get nerves and feel self-conscious during interviews. The best way to combat this is to practice and be prepared!

We do: (10/15)

**Open Discussion**

* What are you most concerned about in interview process?

**Remember:**

This is not an interrogation! Success will come from creating connection and a real, authentic conversation.


## Best Practices: Mental Prep

* Do your homework! Research the company and know the job. Research the people who are interviewing you - find out if they have written on the company blog or posts on LinkedIn and Medium and read them! 

* Practice telling your story and talking about your projects.

* List your top 5 skills (unique!)

    * For each skill, provide details about why this is a skill of yours

    * Give an example  

* Have at least 3 professional stories ready to share (these can also be the examples for the skills - you can use these for answer to other questions)

* Use the STAR Method: 
   * **S**ituation - provide the context and background "Our customers complained..." 

   * **T**ask - describe the problem and challenges "We faced supply chain shortage.." 

   * **A**ction - explaine what you did to solve it and how "I solved it by..."

   * **R**esults - state benefits, savings, rewards, acknowledgement "The impact of..."

* Be yourself! Let your personality come through and be confident. You got this!

* This is a two-way street. You’re interviewing them as much as they’re interviewing you. Have questions to ask!

* This should be a dialogue, not an interrogation!

## Guided Practice: (10/25)

"Tell me about yourself." 
- This is an opportunity to channel our professional brands. We’ve all been working on defining our brands. This is your chance to put it into action. This is not an invitation to recite your entire life story or even to go bullet by bullet through your resume. Instead, it’s probably your first and best chance to pitch the hiring manager on why you’re the right one for the job. Consider this simple formula, [the Past-Present-Future formula](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-simple-formula-for-answering-tell-me-about-yourself).

Start with the present - where you are right now.

* What do you do?/What problem do you solve?

Segue into the past - a little about the experiences you’ve had and the skills you’ve gained.

* What makes you different?

Finish with the future - why you are really excited for this particular opportunity.

* Where are you going?/Why should we care?

## We do: Volunteer interviews in front of class

(Volunteers from class answer question, students provide feedback)

* Did they tell a story?

* What was the opportunity?

* Was the opportunity met?

* What could they have done better?

## You do: Independent Practice (30/55)

Each student will take turns answering interview questions.

Turn to your neighbor. One of you will be the interviewer and one will be the interviewee.

Interviewers will ask the interviewee a minimum of 3 questions (10 minutes). Questions should include:

* Tell me about yourself.

* 2+ questions from [30 Behavioral Interview Questions You Should Be Ready to Answer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gtBdi394fuOdcnFOmpwapTmK2b8NfRFIzeq-vZs7geM/edit#heading=h.hhubctteg3x0)

The Interviewer will give feedback to the interviewee (5 minutes)

* As a group, we will share and discuss their feedback together and complete the [Peer Review Interview Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L1OP8HAgj6MZRJz2Z-Q_v79ATSBWeD_iQOlzuiPzoQo/edit#gid=1104109572).

After 15 min, we’ll switch roles.
