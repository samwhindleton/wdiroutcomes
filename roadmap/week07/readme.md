# Preparing for the Behavioral Interview + Negotiating Like a Boss 

## Framing: 

Everyone’s brand is different and unique; it is how you present yourself that matters. We all get nerves and feel self-conscious during interviews. The best way to combat this is to practice and be prepared!

Negotiating can be hard and intimidating. No matter how many times you have negotiated, how much money you have, or if you are an employer or job seeker - we are all weird about money! We’ll give you the tools and practice today to make this process less intimidating for you.

## Learning Objectives:

Everyone’s brand is different and unique, it is how you present yourself that matters! This workshop will help students understand how to properly prepare for the interview.
