## Portfolio:

## What makes a great portfolio:

* Clean and professional

* Shows your unique personality

**Goals of a Portfolio:**

* Designed to solve a problem for a user

* Showcases personal brand and unique attributes

* Consistent output across multiple medias

* Projects presented are quality over quantity

* Demonstrates technical skill

* Depth of process communicated effectively

* Shows impact of work and validation

* Your role is clear vs. others’ roles in projects

* Build trust with employers (prove you can do the work that they need you to do)

**Portfolios should communicate:**

* Who you are and what you do

* What you have worked on

* How to contact you

**Audience:**

* Future Employers (Hiring Managers/Recruiters/Data Scientists)

* People who are curious about your skills

**The Parts to Your Portfolio & Must Haves:**

* Initial page that pulls reader in for more information, create a tease so they want more

* About page: Headshot, short description (brand statement + a bit more), should be clear who you are and what you do

* Each project should have a description that highlights your methodology and process with a screenshot

* Contact page: Links to your Resume, LinkedIn, Github and contact information

## Blogging
Blogging is a great way to share your technical talents with both non technical and technical audiences as a job seeker to gain exposure to who you are and what you do. Think about how hiring managers can gain insight into how you think. What if you are not sitting right next to them to walk them through your project. Your blog can do that for them!

## Blogs & Project Best Practices:
Projects are a great way to showcase your your skills in a way that that your user can see how you actually put the skills you learned to action.  With each project, think about how you can convey your talents, your skills, your role, and the impact/result of the scenario.  Here are some general best practices!  

Each of your projects should cover the below flow:
* Data gathering 
* Data cleaning 
* Exploring data
* Modeling with data 
* Communicating results 

When writing about your project, here are some questions to keep in mind. 

* What question you are looking to answer?
* Why does this question matter?
* What data did you use?
* Where you got the data?
* How was the data sampled?
* How was the data obtained?
* How did you explore the data?
* How did you model the data?
* Why you chose to model it that way?
* What code did you write / use?
* How did you fit the model?
* How did you validated the model?
* How you know the results make sense?
* How did you visualized the results?
* How you would communicate the results to others?
* What did you learn?
* What you would do differently if you did this project again?
* If you were going to continue this work, what next steps you would take with this project?
* How you would explain what you did to a data scientist?
* How you would explain what you did to a non-data scientist


## GA Profiles:

We’ll walk you through best practices in creating your GA profile. It is handy to have your updated resume handy.

Create your draft GA Profile.  You will need to use the email address that you signed up for GA with to access GA Profiles.

## Remainder of class:
 
Create your draft GA Profile. Remember that once your GA Profile is live, it is visible to hiriring partners and recruiters. Be extra diligent with your spelling, grammar and attention to detail. 

Once you feel like you are ready to submit, have 3 classmates peers review it. 

By the end of class, you should have your peer reviewed GA Profile submitted and the domain name to your Portfolio created.
This is also a great time to meet 1:1 with your coach to answer any questions you might have for Outcomes. 


## Homework 

Homework due next Monday at 7 pm:

### Peer Reviewed GA Profile

### Portfolio Domain Name Created

### Reach out to 3 data professionals to set up 1:1 information meetings or phone calls to learn more about their role/company

Keep this in your own personal list and/or job tracker, we won't be collecting it but will be asking about it in 1:1 meetings.

There is nothing to submit in Github this week.
