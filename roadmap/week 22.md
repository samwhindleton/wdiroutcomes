### Updating your LinkedIn 
First of all, turn off notifications when you are making lots of edits (Click your headshot > Settings + Privacy > Privacy tab > "Sharing Profile Edits" half way down the page)

Make sure your contact information is listed (Click on your headshot > scroll down halfway down the page on the righthand side "Contact and Personal Info" 

Update your tagline (under your name)
- Examples: Data Scientist (Even if you don't feel like it's true, put it up there!) 

Once your resume is final, you can copy and paste the content into LinkedIn, but encourage you to update the basics.
