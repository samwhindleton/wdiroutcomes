**Themes:** Developing Your Brand

## Crafting Your Brand Statement: 
We know this is tough! Remember that this is just a starting point. 

## Here's the step by step process to help you write your draft. 

**Step 1: Identify your top 5 themes** 
  - Look at the notes from the branding workshop, your personality test results, and your responses from the Branding Part 1 worksheet. What are the recurring themes? What are the ones that you have done consistently and effectively throughout your career and life and that you can defend with examples? (Examples: Leader, team-player, kind, generous, influencer, visionary, calm). 
  
**Step 2: What's the benefit to these themes?** 
- For example: The benefit of being a visionary could be that you inspire a team to move forward. The benefit of being a problem solver is that you don't stop until every hurdle is overcome. List as many benefits as you can think for each of your themes. 
  
**Step 3: Build a statement that strings these benefits together concisely, powerfully and effectively.** 
- Practice and wordsmith your statement to communicate your most authentic self that tells your story, highlights your strengths, and embodies who you are as a person and professional. This is going to be challenging! If you get stuck, we recommend creating lots of different versions.
